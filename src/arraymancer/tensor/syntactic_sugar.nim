template at*[T](t: Tensor[T], args: varargs[untyped]): untyped =
  ## Slice a Tensor and collapse singleton dimension.
  ##
  ## Input:
  ##   - a Tensor
  ##   - and:
  ##     - specific coordinates (``varargs[int]``)
  ##     - or a slice (cf. tutorial)
  ## Returns:
  ##   - a value or a view of the Tensor corresponding to the slice
  ##     Singleton dimension are collapsed
  ## Usage:
  ##   See the ``[]`` macro
