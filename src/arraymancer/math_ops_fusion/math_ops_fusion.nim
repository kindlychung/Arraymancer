## The auto-rewrite do not seem to work :/

# template rewriteLn1p*{ln(`+`(1,x))}(x: typed): type(x) =
#   ## Fuse ``ln(1 + x)`` into a single operation.
#   ##
#   ## Operation fusion leverage the Nim compiler and should not be called explicitly.
#   ln1p x
#
# template rewriteLn1p*{ln(`+`(x,1))}(x: typed): type(x) =
#   ## Fuse ``ln(x + 1)`` into a single operation.

#   ln1p x

# Note: we don't create the FMA proc as detection of hardware support happens at GCC
# compilation time. Furthermore, the fallback is slower than doing (x*y) + z
# because the fallback does the intermediate computation at full precision.
# So, trust the compiler
